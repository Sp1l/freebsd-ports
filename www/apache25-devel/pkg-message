To run apache www server from startup, add apache25_enable="yes"
in your /etc/rc.conf. Extra options can be found in startup script.

Your hostname must be resolvable using at least 1 mechanism in
/etc/nsswitch.conf typically DNS or /etc/hosts or apache might
have issues starting depending on the modules you are using.

            /!\ THIS IS ALPHA-GRADE SOFTWARE /!\

   This port is provided as an early access version and you
   are discouraged from using this in production environments

   If built with modular MPM and no MPM is activated in
   httpd.conf, then mpm_prefork will be activated as default
   MPM in etc/apache24/modules.d to keep compatibility with
   existing php/perl/python modules!

Please compare the existing httpd.conf with httpd.conf.sample
and merge missing modules/instructions into httpd.conf!
